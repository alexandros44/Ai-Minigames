## About

In this repository you can find all sorts of different games played by your computer. As you can see I used all sorts of different algorithms just to expirement and understand them.

*You can identify the algorithm that was used by reading the games directory name.* 

## Technologies ⚙️

#### The technologies that I used for every project are listed below:

| Game Name     | Language Used | Libraries Used            |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------------------:|
| Snake Game    | Python        | pygame, tensorflow         |
| Tic Tac Tow   | Python        | p5                        |
| Dot           | Javascript    | p5                        |
| Dot2          | Javascript    | p5                        |

*If I missed a game it is probably because I did not modified the `MD` file.*

## Game State

#### Those are the progress of every game inside the repository.

| Game Name     | Finished       | What need to be implemented      |
| ------------- |:--------------:|:--------------------------------:|
| Snake Game    | ✔️            | Nothing / -                      |
| Tic Tac Tow   | ✔️            | Nothing / -                      |
| Dot           | ✔️            | Nothing / -                      |
| Dot2          | ✔️            | Nothing / -                      |


*Again, If I missed a game it is probably because I did not modified the `MD` file.*

## Conlusion ✨

This repository is mostly for me to begin learning the art of reinforcement learning, more specificaly Q-learing. 

Now you can also find more than Q-learning project. For example, there is a `MiniMax` algorithm for `Tic Tac Toe`.
